Recommended use of the endpoints:		
	"For clinical outcome endpoints, we recommend the use of PFI for progression-free interval, and OS for overall survival. Both endpoints are relatively accurate. Given the relatively short follow-up time, PFI is preferred over OS. Detailed recommendations please refer to Table 3 in the accompanying paper."	
	"DFI was derived based on data fields of ""treatment_outcome_first_course"", ""residual_tumor"", and ""margin_status"". The endpoint is relatively accurate. For SKCM, THYM, UVM, DFI is not available."	
	"DSS is relatively accurate for CESC, PAAD, and UVM, and is approximated for other tumor types."	
		
		
Data Columns:		
Original Clinical Data		
	"type: cancer type such as brca, ov, blca, skcm, gbm, and so on."	
	"10 features from the main files: ""age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis"",  ""gender"", ""race"", ""ajcc_pathologic_tumor_stage"", ""clinical_stage"", ""histological_type"", ""histological_grade"", ""initial_pathologic_dx_year"", ""menopause_status"", ""birth_days_to"" ;  The values in  ""clinical_stage"" for ""THYM"" are its ""masaoka_stage"" values."	
Updated Clinical Data from follow-up files		
	vital_status: the latest updated vital status from follow-up data.	
	tumor_status: the latest updated tumor status from follow-up data.	
	"last_contact_days_to: the latest ""last_contact_days_to"" updated from the follow-up data files."	
	"death_days_to: the available ""death_days_to"" from the follow-up data files."	
	"cause_of_death: the available ""cause_of_death"" from the follow-up data files."	
	"new_tumor_event_type, new_tumor_event_site, new_tumor_event_site_other are the values corresponding to new_tumor_event_dx_days_to"	
	new_tumor_event_dx_days_to: smallest days from all new_tumor_event_dx_days_to in follow-up files	
	"treatment_outcome_first_course (for deriving DFI): the available data in the field of ""treatment_outcome_first_course"" from the main and follow-up files."	
	"residual_tumor (for deriving DFI): 5 diseases did not have ""treament_outcome_first_course"" but had ""residual_tumor"" from the main file. These 5 diseases were CHOL ,LIHC, MESO, SARC, and THCA."	
	"margin_status (for deriving DFI): BRCA did not have ""treatment_outcome_first_course"" nor ""residual_tumor"" but had ""margin_status"". SARC also had this field but its field of ""residual_tumor"" was used."	
Derived Clinical Data		
	"OS: overall survival event, 1 for death from any cause, 0 for alive."	
	"OS.time: overall survival time in days, last_contact_days_to or death_days_to, whichever is larger."	
	"DSS: disease-specific survival event, 1 for patient whose vital_status was Dead and tumor_status was WITH TUMOR. If a patient died from the disease shown in field of cause_of_death, the status of DSS would be 1 for the patient.  0 for patient whose vital_status was Alive or whose vital_status was Dead and tumor_status was  TUMOR FREE. This is not a 100% accurate definition but is the best we could do with this dataset. Technically a patient could be with tumor but died of a car accident and therefore incorrectly considered as an event."	
	"DSS.time: disease-specific survival time in days, last_contact_days_to or death_days_to, whichever is larger."	
	"DFI: disease-free interval event, 1 for patient having new tumor event whether it is a local recurrence, distant metastasis, new primary tumor of the cancer, including cases with a new tumor event whose type is N/A.  Disease free was defined by: first, treatment_outcome_first_course is ""Complete Remission/Response""; if the tumor type doesn't have ""treatment_outcome_first_course"" then disease-free was defined by the value ""R0"" in the field of ""residual_tumor""; otherwise, disease-free was defined by the value ""negative"" in the field of ""margin_status"". If the tumor type did not have any of these fields, then its DFI was NA."	
		0 for censored otherwise. New primary tumor in other organ was censored; patients who were Dead with tumor without new tumor event are excluded; patients wih stage IV are excluded too.
	"DFI.time: disease-free interval time in days, new_tumor_event_dx_days_to for events, or for censored cases, either last_contact_days_to or death_days_to, whichever is applicable."	
	"PFI: progression-free interval event, 1 for patient having new tumor event whether it was a progression of disease, local recurrence, distant metastasis, new primary tumors all sites , or died with the cancer without new tumor event, including cases with a new tumor event whose type is N/A."	
		0 for censored otherwise. 
	"PFI.time: progression-free interval time in days, for events, either new_tumor_event_dx_days_to or death_days_to,  whichever is applicable; or for censored cases, either last_contact_days_to or death_days_to, whichever is applicable."
